      desk, lying beetween the copies of <i>Nature</i> ,<i>New
        Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals her work
        had appeared in, was well thumbed copy of <cite> On the road
        </cite>.It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and
        the more longer she spent in these four walls the more she
        felt she needed to be free.</p>

    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,sitting under
      a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaming that<q>Work is
      the refuge of people who have nothing beter to do.</q>
      Althoughmany consideered her pioneering work, unraveling
      the secrects of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleicacid">DNA</abbr>,
